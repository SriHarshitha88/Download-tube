# YouTube Downloader
A basic YouTube downloader that allows you to download videos in HD, SD, or audio-only formats.
## Overview
This project is a YouTube video downloader built using **Pytube**, a Python library specifically for downloading content from YouTube. The graphical user interface (GUI) is created with **Tkinter**, Pythonâ€™s standard toolkit for building desktop applications.
## Requirements
Make sure you have **Tkinter** and **Pytube** installed before running the program. This downloader was developed on Windows 10, but it should work on any system with Python installed.
### Installation Instructions
1. Download the latest version of Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Open a command prompt or terminal and install the required libraries with the following commands:
    ```bash
    pip install pytube
    ```
    ```bash
    pip install tkinter
    ```
## Running the Program
- To launch the application, double-click on the `Downloader.py` file if it has been made executable.
- Alternatively, you can open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the folder where the script is saved, and run the following command:
    ```bash
    python Downloader.py
    ```
## Troubleshooting
If the program fails to work as expected, it could be due to improper installation of the required libraries. To resolve this:
- Uninstall the libraries and reinstall them using the correct commands.
- Make sure Python and all necessary packages are correctly set up on your machine.
